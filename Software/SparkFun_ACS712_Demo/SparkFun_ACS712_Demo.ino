    Uses an Arduino to set up the ACS712 and ACS723 Current Sensors
    See the tutorial at: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/current-sensor-breakout-acs723-hookup-guide

    Parts you may need:
    - 100 Ohm, 1/2W or greater resistor OR two 220 Ohm 1/4 resistors in parallel
    - ACS712 Breakout with on-board amplifier or ACS723 Current Sensor (Low Current)

    Optional equipment:
    - Oscilloscope
    - Multimeter (or two)
    - A power supply with current limiting/constant current would be handy to calibrate the device without using resistors

const int analogInPin = A0;

// Number of samples to average the reading over
// Change this to make the reading smoother... but beware of buffer overflows!
const int avgSamples = 10;

int sensorValue = 0;

float sensitivity = 100.0 / 500.0; //100mA per 500mV = 0.2
float Vref = 2500; // Output voltage with no current: ~ 2500mV or 2.5V

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the analog in value:
  for (int i = 0; i < avgSamples; i++)
  {
    sensorValue += analogRead(analogInPin);

    // wait 2 milliseconds before the next loop
    // for the analog-to-digital converter to settle
    // after the last reading:
    delay(2);

  }

  sensorValue = sensorValue / avgSamples;

  // The on-board ADC is 10-bits -> 2^10 = 1024 -> 5V / 1024 ~= 4.88mV
  // The voltage is in millivolts
  float voltage = 4.88 * sensorValue;

  // This will calculate the actual current (in mA)
  // Using the Vref and sensitivity settings you configure
  float current = (voltage - Vref) * sensitivity;

  // This is the raw sensor value, not very useful without some calculations
  //Serial.print(sensorValue);

  /*************************************************************************************
   * Step 1.)
   * Uncomment and run the following code to set up the baseline voltage 
   * (the voltage with 0 current flowing through the device).
   * Make sure no current is flowing through the IP+ and IP- terminals during this part!
   * 
   * The output units are in millivolts. Use the Arduino IDE's Tools->Serial Plotter
   * To see a plot of the output. Adjust the Vref potentiometer to set the reference
   * voltage. This allows the sensor to output positive and negative currents!
   *************************************************************************************/

  Serial.print(voltage);
  //Serial.print("mV");

  /*************************************************************************************
   * Step 2.)
   * Keep running the same code as above to set up the sensitivity
   * (how many millivolts are output per Amp of current.
   * 
   * This time, use a known load current (measure this with a multimeter)
   * to give a constant output voltage. Adjust the sensitivity by turning the
   * gain potentiometer.
   * 
   * The sensitivity will be (known current)/(Vreading - Vref).
   *************************************************************************************/

    /*************************************************************************************
   * Step 3.)
   * Comment out the code used for the last two parts and uncomment the following code.
   * When you have performed the calibration steps above, make sure to change the 
   * global variables "sensitivity" and "Vref" to what you have set up.
   * 
   * This next line of code will print out the calculated current from these parameters.
   * The output is in mA
   *************************************************************************************/

  //Serial.print(current);
  //Serial.print("mA");


  // -- DO NOT UNCOMMENT BELOW THIS LINE --
  Serial.print("\n");

  // Reset the sensor value for the next reading
